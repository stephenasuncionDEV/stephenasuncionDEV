## Hey 👋🏼

As a child, I was always curious about how things worked. When I was around 10 years old, I became particularly interested in the inner workings of software. I wondered how the simple text editor, notepad.exe, was created. This curiosity sparked my interest in programming, and I have been learning and exploring the field ever since.
